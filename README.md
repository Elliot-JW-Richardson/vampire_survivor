# vampire_survivor
Attempting to create a deep-q network that will learn to play the game Vampire Survivors. A letent encoding of the state space will be used, as well as generated 'learning' data to try and bootstrap the DQN ahead of reinforcement learning.

No training data is included here as, being video data, the size of the file is probibitively large to store remotely.
